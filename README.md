Actos
=====

Actos is a desktop shell setup for the KDE Plasma Desktop.

It contains plasmoids, scripts, icons and themes to create a different experience that provides quick access to the most used system functions and helps you focus on getting work done. 

Actos also tries to promote less-used features of the KDE Plasma Desktop, like Activities, by providing a different interface for accesing them.

## Quick start

### Overview

* Dashboard
* Topbar
** App indicator
** Systemmenus

* Dock

### Launching apps

Apps are the central point of any OS, and Actos tries to facilitate access as easy as possible to them.

You can launch apps either by browsing trough them in the Dashboard, where they are sorted by category. Or, if you already know the name of the app your are looking for, just open the Dashboard and start typing. 

### Window management

With Actos, you can manage windows whichever way suits you best.

If you want to always get a quick overview of all your open windows with live-previews, you can use Dashboard to switch between open windows. 

Otherwise, if you prefer working with icons, you can just switch between using using the Dock.

### Activities

Actos tries to expose the very powerfull Activities concept, found in Plasma, by providing a different interface for it.
